## Purpose

Centos version of the ansible deployment of [Carl Danley's Radium deployment](https://github.com/carldanley/radium-cluster) which is itself based on Kelsey Hightower's [kubernetes the "hard" way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way).

## Goals

Running an on-prem Kubernetes cluster on OpenStack. The main goals of these ansible plays are:

1. To introduce (and manage) a highly available on-prem cluster
1. Demonstrate best practices for running a kubernetes cluster
1. Keep things clear and simple for others to grok

## Cluster Specifications

### Software

This cluster bootstraps 3 etcd nodes, 3 kubernetes masters and 3 kubernetes nodes.
